The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal,
the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one
species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.
However, the existence of up to eight extant giraffe
species has been described, based upon research into
the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as
morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other
species are extinct, prehistoric species known from
fossils.
