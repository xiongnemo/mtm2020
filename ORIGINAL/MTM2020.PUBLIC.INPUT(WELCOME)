If you can read this, you've opened a mainframe data set
for Level 1 of Master the Mainframe. Congratulations!

A word or two about Data Sets:
    Sequential data sets assume data is stored in records, one after the other
    Partitioned data sets usually contain entries called "members"
    A partitioned data set is sometimes called a Library
    There's a third type of data set. Read about it here:

Even though they show up as Files and Folders in VS Code, you should be
careful not to make assumptions about what type of data set you're working
with, as data sets can take many different forms, depending on what's needed.
